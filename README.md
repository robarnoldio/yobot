# yobot
A python script showing temperature control, targeting Raspberry Pi zero. Uses DS18B20 for temp sensing.

<h3>Concept of operations</h3>
<p>I aim to make a controller to activate a Crock Pot slow cooker based on a temperature reading. This will help in making yogurt. One of the key steps in yogurt making is culturing inoculated milk at a temperature that's ideal for the strain of bacteria you added. A typical culture time is eight to twelve hours. This device should let me load pint mason jars with inoculated milk into a Crock Pot (with a water bath to transfer the heat evenly), and leave it overnight to culture, while the device keeps the temp in the target range.</p>

<p>I decided to target Pi zero since it's inexpensive and this will be a one-trick-pony kind of device. Crock Pots can be had cheaply at thrift stores and garage sales. A two-relay module that is set up to work with the Pi is only four bucks, and a temp sensor in a stainless thermal well is a couple of bucks on Amazon.</p>

<p>Stuff I hope to learn: a bit more about using a Pi zero to do useful things, how to log data and visualize it, controlling AC line power devices from the Pi, thinking through the issues of embedded devices, and getting more comfortable with GitHub.</p>

<p>Stuff I'm not tring to do: implement a PID controller, Internet of things/junk, control the yogurt from my iPhone, deal with the scalding phase of the yogurt making process (which wants a much higher temp).</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>coming soon</p>
