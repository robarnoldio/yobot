# yobot
A python script showing temperature control, targeting Raspberry Pi zero. Uses DS18B20 for temp sensing.

<h3>Concept of operations</h3>
<p>I aim to make a controller to activate a Crock Pot slow cooker based on a temperature reading. This will help in making yogurt. One of the key steps in yogurt making is culturing hte inoculated milk at a temperature that's ideal for the strain of bacteria you added. A typical culture time is eight to twelve hours. This device should let me load pint mason jars with inoculated milk into a Crock Pot (with a water bath to transfer the heat evenly), and leave it overnight to culture, while the device keeps the temp in the target range.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>coming soon</p>
